          <h2 >Correlations Between Health Risks and Poverty</h2>
          <p>One would expect there is a correlation between health risks and poverty. Generally speaking those in poverty have to make 
            choices regarding jobs, housing, food, hygiene and preventive healthcare that tend to lead to outcomes 
            that put their health at greater risk.</p>
          <p>In the above chart, we anlyze poverty and healthcare data provided by the US Census Bureau through the 2014 American 
            Community Survey. Surprisingly, the chart suggests that the correlation between poverty and having healthcare is impacted by
            the state you live in. Based on outlier data for Massachusetts and Texas, one can glean from the chart above that State 
            Public Policy can have an impact on the health outcomes of its citizens.</p>
          <p>The American Community Survey provides a wide range of important statistics about people and housing for every community 
            in the nation. This survey is the only source of local estimates for most of the more than 40 topics 
            it covers for communities across the nation. For example, it produces statistics for language, education, commuting, 
            employment, mortgage status and rent, as well as income, poverty and health insurance. The one-year statistical data that 
            we are presenting, is summarized by state for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia.</p>
